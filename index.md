# Welcome to Computation Structures

This course introduces the **architecture** of digital systems, emphasising structural principles common to a wide range of technologies, including:
* Multi-level implementation strategies
* Definition of new primitives (e.g., gates, instructions, procedures, and processes), and 
* Their mechanisation using lower-level elements. 

By the end of this course, you're also expected to know about: 
* Analysis of potential concurrency and precedence constraints, and performance measures.
* Instruction set design issues and architectural support for contemporary software structures.

Have fun!
