# Finite State Machine

## Overview

The main aim for this chapter is to **understand** how we can utilise the topics we have learned in the previous chapters: pertaining *combinational logic* devices and synchronous *sequential logic* devices to create a specific device called the *finite state machine* (FSM). The FSM is an abstract mathematical model of a sequential logic function.

We frequently use FSMs in our daily lives:  traffic lights, vending machine, heating system, elevator, electronic locks (security systems), railroad systems, turnstile, alarm clock, and many more. We can create an FSM by implementing the functionality of the state machine using combinational logic devices, and assemble them with memory devices to form a complete (sequential logic) FSM circuitry. The FSM comes in two flavours: Moore and Mealy, which schematic is as shown: 

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/y157lzv1g0lmwpl/Q2.png?raw=1"  width="80%" height = "80%">

We will learn in detail how each of them works in the later sections. 

  

## Abstraction of Finite State Machine


A FSM (Finite State Machine) is formally defined to have:

1.  A set of $k$ states: $S_1, S_2, ..., S_k$ (where one of them should be the "initial" state)

1.  A set of $m$ inputs: $I_1, I_2, ..., I_m$

1.  A set of $n$ outputs: $O_1, O_2, ..., O_n$

1.  Transition rules $s'(S_i, I_i)$ for each of the $k$ states and $m$ inputs

1.  Output rules: $f(S_i)$ for each of the $k$ states



  

## State Machine Diagram and the Truth Table

We can represent a state machine in two forms: ****state transition diagram or truth table****.  

Suppose we have a simple digital lock machine, that will open only if we give the password: `0110`. The following state diagram illustrates how that lock works:
 
  <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/peuby3etfi3twvx/Q2%202.png?raw=1"  width="100%" height = "100%">

That **S_X** in bold represents the *initial* state. The **arrows** are the possible *transitions* between states. The little numbers beside the arrows are the kind of *input* required for state transition to happen. The word $U$ inside each state circle is the *output* of each state. If it is unlocked, $U=1$, otherwise $U=0$ for a locked output 
* When input `0110` is entered in that *exact* sequence, you'll land at `S_3` -- and the lock will be **unlocked**. 

* If at `S_0, S_1,` or `S_3` you *mistakenly* entered `0` instead of `1` (the correct subsequent digit to enter), then its counted as you *restarted* to `S_0` (not `S_X` -- because the first digit of the password is `0`). 
* If at `S_3` you entered `1`, then you land at `S_1` because its counted that the latest correct sequence so far is `01` (the `0` refers to the input entered that caused transition from `S2` to `S_3`).

There are **five** states in total, and we can encode them using 3 bits: `000, 001, 010, 011`, and `110` for `S_X, S_0, S_1, S2`, and `S_3` respectively. 
> Since we have 5 states, we need at least $\log_2(5) = 3$ (rounded up) bits to represent the states, *any* 5 distinct values  from `000` to `111`. **This is called encoded representation** of the states.

Then, we can represent the functionality of the FSM in terms of a truth table below

$$
\begin{matrix}
S_i &  In & S_{i+1} & Out\\
\hline
000 & 0 & 001 & 0\\
000 & 1 & 000 & 0 \\
001 & 0 & 001 & 0\\
001 & 1 & 010 & 0\\
010 & 0 & 001 & 0\\
010 & 1 & 011 & 0\\
011 & 0 & 110 & 0 \\
011 & 1 & 000 & 0\\
110 & 0 & 001 & 1 \\
110 & 1 & 011 & 1\\
\hline
\end{matrix}
$$


<span style="background-color:yellow">  **Important**: $s$ state bits allow us to encode up to  $2^s$ different states. </span>


*Note: the output column in the figure above contains the output that depends on the *current* state only (also known as the Moore Machine, see next section).* 





  

## Moore and Mealy Machine

  

There are two types of FSM (and equivalently two ways to draw the state transition diagram). The lock state transition diagram  shown in the previous section is called the **Moore** machine.

Notice that the the output is *drawn on the state (circle)*. This means that the output of the machine  depends on the *current* state. 

The second type of FSM is called the **Mealy** machine, and when we can draw the state transition diagram for Mealy machines by *drawing the output on the transition arrows*. This means that the output of the machine depends on both the *current* input and *current* state. 

We can implement the same features (of a machine) using either Moore or Mealy configuration, for example, suppose we have a digital lock that can be opened with the password `011`. 
> This is similar to the digital lock in the previous section that requires the password `0110` to open, just that this is a *shorter* version to make it more compact to explain the topic. 

The state diagram for a Moore implementation of this lock and a Mealy implementation of this lock is as shown: 

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/yirju0klzdsbj9y/Q3.png?raw=1"  width="100%" height = "100%">


We have 4 states for the Moore machine, so we can encode the states as `00, 01, 10,` and `11` for states `S_0, S_1, S2,` and `S_3` respectively. 

The truth table for the Moore Machine above is (combinations that don't apply to the FSM is omitted):
$$
\begin{matrix}
S_i &  In & S_{i+1} & Out\\
\hline
00 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
00 & 1 & 00 & 0 \\
01 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
01 & 1 & 10 & 0\\
10 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
10 & 1 & 11 & 0\\
11 & 0 & 01 & 1 \\
11 & 1 & 00 & 1\\
\hline
\end{matrix}
$$


For the Mealy machine, we have **less** states and we can simply encode the states as `00, 01,` and `10` for `S_0, S_1`, and `S2` respectively. The truth table for the Mealy Machine above is:
$$
\begin{matrix}
S_i &  In & S_{i+1} & Out\\
\hline
00 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
00 & 1 & 00 & 0 \\
01 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
01 & 1 & 10 & 0\\
10 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
10 & 1 & 00 & 1\\
\hline
\end{matrix}
$$

**Conclusion:** Both tables have the same abstract functionality: which is a lock that unlocks once we key in the right password (`011`). We can implement this lock either as a Moore or a Mealy machine. 
>*One apparent difference is that a Mealy machine takes less number of states to implement, and a Moore lock machine takes 1 cycle *slower* to **unlock** than a Mealy lock machine. We will compare the pros and cons on each machine further in the later section.* 

## Building a State Machine


We can build an FSM using Flip-Flops or registers, and combinational logic units such as using ROMs, or multiplexers among others. At first, we can transform the Moore Machine truth table in the previous section, pasted here again for easier reference, into its boolean equation form:

$$
\begin{matrix}
S_i &  In & S_{i+1} & Out\\
\hline
00 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
00 & 1 & 00 & 0 \\
01 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
01 & 1 & 10 & 0\\
10 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
10 & 1 & 11 & 0\\
11 & 0 & 01 & 1 \\
11 & 1 & 00 & 1\\
\hline
\end{matrix}
$$

{% raw %}

Since there are two state bits, we can label the first bit (MSB) as $$S_{0_i}$$ and the second bit (LSB) as  $$S_{1_i}$$ (at time step $i$). We technically have three input bits: $$S_{0_i}$$, $$S_{1_i}$$, and $In$,  and three output bits: $$S_{0_{i+1}}$$, $$S_{1_{i+1}}$$, and $Out$  in total for the combinational logic part of the FSM. 

The boolean equation for the FSM  (Moore) truth table above is therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{0_{i+1}} &= \overline{S_{0_i}} \cdot {S_{1_i}} \cdot \text{in} + S_{0_i} \cdot \overline{{S_{1_i}}} \cdot \text{in}\\
S_{1_{i+1}} &= \overline{S_{0_i}} \cdot \overline{{S_{1_i}}} \cdot \overline{\text{in}} + \overline{S_{0_i}} \cdot {S_{1_i}} \cdot \overline{\text{in}} + S_{0_i} \cdot \overline{{S_{1_i}}} \cdot \overline{\text{in}} + S_{0_i} \cdot \overline{{S_{1_i}}} \cdot \text{in}  + S_{0_i} \cdot {S_{1_i}} \cdot \overline{\text{in}}\\
Out &= S_{0_i}  \cdot S_{1_i} \cdot \overline{\text{in}}  + S_{0_i} \cdot S_{1_i} \cdot \text{in}  
\end{aligned}
$$
{% endraw %}

> Exercise: Can you minimise the equation above further? For the output bits, its obvious that current input does not matter since it is a Moore machine (can be proved mathematically as well by minimising the $Out$ boolean equation). 

To build the equivalent Mealy machine, we can transform the Mealy Machine truth table (pasted below for easier reference) into a boolean equation:


$$
\begin{matrix}
S_i &  In & S_{i+1} & Out\\
\hline
00 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
00 & 1 & 00 & 0 \\
01 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
01 & 1 & 10 & 0\\
10 & 0 & 01 & 0\\
10 & 1 & 00 & 1\\
\hline
\end{matrix}
$$


$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{0_{i+1}} &= \overline{S_{0_{i}}} \cdot S_{1_{i}} \cdot In\\
S_{1_{i+1}} &= \overline{S_{0_{i}}} \cdot \overline{S_{1_{i}}} \cdot \overline{In} + \overline{S_{0_{i}}} \cdot S_{1_{i}} \cdot \overline{In} + S_{0_{i}} \cdot \overline{S_{1_{i}}} \cdot \overline{In}\\
Out &= S_{0_{i}} \cdot \overline{S_{1_{i}}} \cdot In
\end{aligned}
$$

> Exercise: Can you minimise the equation above further? 

Now that we have the boolean equations for each machine ready, we can simply construct the machine using 2-bit Flip-Flops / Registers, and a combinational logic device. 

One possible schematic for the Moore version of the lock is :

 One possible schematic for the Mealy version of the lock is:
 
 <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/bu45lxkolwzbj8n/meally_1.png?raw=1"  width="70%" height = "70%">
 
> Both diagrams above are obtained after minimising the boolean expression. There are other ways to construct them machine, such as using only NAND gates, only NOR gates, only multiplexers, or ROMs. Try it yourself as practice.


## Differences between Moore and Mealy Machine

  

There are some differences when implementing a specification as a Moore machine vs a Mealy machine. A Moore machine has these characteristics:

1. The output  obtained is **depends** **only** on the **current** state (regardless of the input). For example in our simple digital lock above, the output = `1` (unlocked) only happens in State $S_3$ (`11`), regardless of whether the input is 0 or 1. 

2.  Sometimes, a Moore machine **may require more states**. It requires 4 states for the simple digital lock (vs 3 states in its Mealy configuration). 

3. The output of a Moore machine is *synchronized* with the state change.  In the example of our smaller digital lock above, the lock is unlocked **only in the *next*** cycle (only in the next cycle where you'll reach $S_3$ *after* you keyed in the password: `011` in the current cycle). 

  

On the other hand, a Mealy machine has these characteristics:

1.  The output of a Mealy machine is affected by both the current state and the current input.

2. Mealy machines react *immediately* with the presence of an input (instead of having to obtain the output in the next cycle). We can see that in the digital lock's truth table, that when we are at state $S_2$ = `10`, we obtain the unlock (out = `1`) state **immediately** after we key in the last digit of the password. 

3. Typically we can have *less states* and *less transitions*. This means that we can potentially use less registers and logic gates (for the CL) in a Mealy machine, potentially reducing its cost (and size). 

  

Further observation: A Mealy machine can seem *faster* or *more responsive* than the Moore machine since the output can  be produced approximately $t_{pd}$ (or almost immediately if $t_{pd}$ of the last CL unit is small) after input arrives. However  the output of a Moore machine is only obtained in the **next CLK cycle**. 

One CLK period typically takes much longer than the $t_{pd}$ of that smaller CL (at the output of the Flip-Flop) because:
- Dynamic discipline has to be obeyed, thus $t_{pd}$ of the bigger CL should be smaller than the CLK period 
- Logically, $t_{pd}$ of the smaller CL should be smaller than the $t_{pd}$ of a bigger CL, supporting the statement above. 


## Enumerating FSM 

  

The goal of this section is that, after establishing the abstraction (specs) of the FSM, we want to make a physical machine that can conform to the functional specification of our designed FSM. For any FSM, we can say that in general we need $i$ input bits, $s$ state bits, and $o$ output bits.


The truth table will look something like this for any *arbitrary* FSM with  $i$ input bits, $s$ state bits, and $o$ output bits:
 

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/bmm0uh4uzk6mrwe/Q1.png?raw=1"  width="70%" height = "70%">

In short, we need **to create a combinational logic device** that conforms to the FSM's truth table. We have learned several ways to create such devices:

1.  By creating a ROM: use a demultiplexer, with each output bit soldered to conform to the truth table

1.  By deriving the sum of products and use a INV, AND, and OR gates

1.  By deriving the minimal boolean expression and create CMOS circuitry using CMOS recipe



  

Given $i$ input bits, $s$ state bits, and $o$ output bits we have a total combination of $2^{i+s}$ input-state combinations, and each input-state pair has $o$ bits as an output.  

> <span style="background-color:yellow">  Hence, the number of possible FSMs that can be captured with $i$ input bits, $o$ output bits, and $s$ state bits is $2^{(o+s)2^{i+s}}$ FSMs *(Note: some FSMs in these many possible FSMs may be equivalent)*. </span>

*Why is this so?*
-  We have $2^{i+s}$ input-state combinations if we have $i$ input bits and $s$ states -- *to define a particular FSM, we need to decide what is the value of next state and its corresponding output for each state-input combination.* 

-  Each combination results in $o$ output bits and $s$ end-state bits.
- This results in total of: $(o+s)2^{i+s}$ bits (to fill up) in both the output column and the next-state column
- Each bit can take up 2 values: `0` or `1`
-  Therefore we have $2^{(o+s)2^{i+s}}$ different FSMs

> For example, if $i=1, o=1, s=1$, then we can have $256$ different FSMs. The picture below shows 4 examples of the 256 different FSMS to paint a clearer picture. The shaded region (input-state combinations) are always the same, but the two columns on its right (next state-output combinations) always differ by at least one bit to define a *different* FSM. 

  

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/pspqvc7b00homaa/fsms.png?raw=1"  width="100%" height = "100%">
  

The reason we want to **enumerate** number of possible FSMs given $s$ state bits, $i$ input bits, and $o$ output bits is because if we are going to make a *hardware* for this FSM using some generic components such as the multiplexer, ROMs, or other memory unit, we want to know *how many different FSMs* can we program onto this particular hardware size which we probably mass-produce.


## FSM Equivalence and Reduction
FSM A and FSM B shown below have the same functionality, however FSM A has double the amount of states than FSM B. In other words, we could have reduced FSM A by merging **equivalent** states. 
  
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4frikzlus8gcmeo/Q4.png?raw=1"  e4"  width="80%" height = "80%">

To reduce the number of states in an FSM, we need to find pairs of **equivalent** states and merge them. 

<span style="background-color:yellow">  Two states $S_i$ and $S_j$ are equivalent iff:  <span style="background-color:yellow">   for  an  arbitrary input  sequence applied  at  both  states,  the  **same**  **output sequence**  results </span>. 

In FSM A, we can deduce that $S_3$ and $S_2$ are **identical**:
1. In both states, the output is `1`
2. When either states receive input: `0`, it will transition to $S_0$ 
3. When either states receive an input: `1`, it will transition to $S_3$
4. There is no other input that can be fed to either states except the ones in (2) and (3).

Therefore, we can safely merge $S_3$ and $S_2$ into a new state $S_4$. The same steps (1) to (4) can be applied between the new state $S_4$ and state $S_1$, merging the two further and resulting in a minimised FSM like FSM B. 

Having less states will result in less bits to represent the states in the machine, and less transitions (i.e: simpler truth table). This in turn allows us to build the machine at a cheaper cost (less registers used to store state bits) and smaller size.

  

  

## FSM Limitations and Summary

In this chapter, we have learned that we can build an FSM to compute many types of functions, such as implementing the *digital lock*. 

Some problems however, cannot be computed using FSMs, so the notion of FSMs alone is not enough to be an *ultimate* computing device that we need. 

>Remember that the goal of this course is to teach you how to build a **general-purpose computer** from the ground up. A *general-purpose computer* is supposed to an *ultimate computing device,* able to solve *various computational problems and tasks* such as your math homework, running video games, rending graphics, playing music or video, browsing the web, and many more. 

A classic simple example that cannot be computed using FSM is the **parenthesis checker** problem.

The reason that this classic problem cannot be solved by an FSM is because it requires **arbitrarily many states**, simply because **we do not know (prior)** how many parenthesis are there to check, or how many will be left balanced or unbalanced. 

By definition, an FSM needs a **finite** amount of states. It is able to implement only tasks that require finite states, such as implementing junction traffic lights, line following robots, etc, but *not tasks that requires **arbitrarily many** number of states* (i.e: states that depend on input length for example). 

We know that we can definitely write a program that performs parenthesis checking easily, so we know that our computers aren't just a *simple* FSM. In the next chapter, we will learned another class of machine called the Turing Machine that can tackle this issue.
